"""
Since template stings are sometimes difficult to understand. 
Alternatively one can create an object or class which can execute object lookups or even call methods 
inside the f-string.

Making it look right. 
It's nice to be able to include variables in template strings, but sometimes the variables need
a bit of coercion to make them look the way we want them to in the output.

"""
Custom formatters:

While these standard formatters apply to most built-in objects, it is also possible for other
objects to define nonstandard specifiers. For example, if we pass a datetime object into
format, we can use the specifiers used in the datetime.strftime function, as follows:

"""


print("\n")
import datetime
from os import replace 
print("{the_date:%Y-%m-%d %I:%M%p }".format(the_date=datetime.datetime.now()))


"""
The format method:

The format method behaves similarly to f-strings, but there are a couple of differences:
1. It is restricted in what it can look up. You can access attributes on objects or look
up an index in a list or dict, but you can't call a function inside the template
string.
2. You can use integers to access positional arguments passed to the format
method: "{0} world".format('bonjour'). The indexes are optional if you
specify the variables in order: "{} {}".format('hello', 'world').
Eg. is below 

"""
template = "abc{number:*^10d}"
print(template.format(number=32))

"""
Strings are Unicode 

Converting bytes to text:
If we have an array of bytes from somewhere, we can convert it to Unicode using the .decode method on bytes class 
There are many such names; common ones for Western Languages include ASCII, UTF-8 and latin-1. 
eg below
"""
print("\n")
characters = b'\x63\x6c\x69\x63\x68\xe9' # create a byte object. b'' tels it that we creating a byte object instead of normal unicode string
print(characters) 
print(characters.decode("latin-1"))

# converting text to bytes 
print("\n")
characters = "clich√©" 
print(characters.encode("UTF-8"))
print(characters.encode("latin-1"))
print(characters.encode("CP437")) 
print(characters.encode("ascii", errors="replace"))


"""
Mutable byte strings:
The byte type like string is immutable.  We can use index and slice notation on a bytes object and seach for a particular sequence of bytes but we can't 
extend or modify them. 
Due to the inability for modification when dealing with I/O, we use bytearray built-in type which behaves like a list, except it holds bytes. 
The constructor type can accept a bytes object to initailize it. The extend method can be used to append another bytes object to the existing array (for eg, 
when more data comes from a socket or other I/O channel). Slice notation can be used on bytearray to modify the item inline. 

e.g. below 
"""
print("\n")
b = bytearray(b"abcdefgh")
print(b)
b[4:6] = b"\x15\xa3"
print(b)

# If we want to manipulate a sinlge element in a bytearray, we must pass an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive) as the value. 
# This integer represents a specific bytes pattern. If we try to pass a character or bytes object, it will raise an exception 
# a single byte character can be converted using ord function.
print("\n")
b = bytearray(b"abcdef")
print(b)
b[3] = ord(b"g")
b[4] = 68 # maps to ASCII character D
print(b)

"""
The bytearray type has methods that allow it to behave like a list (we can append integer
bytes to it, for example), but also like a bytes object; we can use methods such as count
and find the same way they would behave on a bytes or str object. The difference is that
bytearray is a mutable type, which can be useful for building up complex sequences of
bytes from a specific input source.
